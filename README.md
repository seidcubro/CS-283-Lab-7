# cs283-fa25-todolist-react

This is an example from CS 283 from the Fall 2025 semester to create a simple "to do" app with React.

Please note that for the sake of getting through the example during the scheduled class time, some "shortcuts" are taken that should be completed when building an app intended for production, as described in the lecture.
